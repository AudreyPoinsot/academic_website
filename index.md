## About Me

I am a second year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/">INRIA</a> (Paris, France) under the supervision of <a href="https://www.lri.fr/~marc/">Marc Shoenauer</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=V3fDydQAAAAJ&hl/">Alessandro Leite</a>. 

At the intersection of Causality and Machine Learning, my current research project aims to improve decision-support tools with a specific interest in robustness and uncertainty. Having worked as a consultant for a year before starting my Ph.D. funded by this same company, my research is driven by concrete use cases and applications. 

My goal is to provide advise and knowledge in order to democratize the use of causal reasoning in statistical analysis for decision-making by providing tools to create value easily, sustainably, and fairly.


## Research Interests

- **<u>Causality:</u>** causal data generation & augmentation, causal benchmarks, causal uncertainty quantification
- **<u>Machine Learning:</u>** Trustworthy ML (e.g. bias reduction, robustness, fairness, generalisation ...)
